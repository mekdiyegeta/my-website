      <h1>Education Background</h1>
      <p>Hi, I’m Mekdes. Since my childhood, I’ve always enjoyed identifying and 
        solving problems—even before I knew what a programmer was. Today, I’m happy
         with the education I’m pursuing, as it allows me to grow as a true problem solver.
          I completed my studies from
         elementary through grade 12 at some of the best schools in Addis Ababa,
          Ethiopia, where I was known as a diligent and outstanding student.      
              Currently, I’m a third-year Computer Science student at Wolaita Sodo 
              University, working toward my BSc degree. If all goes well, I’ll proudly 
             graduate next year—God willing. Along the way, I’ve also taken several courses and
              short trainings that continue to strengthen my programming skills and professional
               growth</p>
